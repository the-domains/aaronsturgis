            <title><![CDATA[Fundamentalism is to Christianity.....]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Fundamentalism is to Christianity.....</h1><p>It's been crazy yet compelling for many.  Somewhere along the course of history the idea that science and religion (particularly Christianity) could not co-exist.  It was an either/or. It drives me nuts when some Christians believe that we have a fight against science.  That somehow science is against faith. There is this idea (and it has only grown in recent decades) that if you are Christian then Science is against faith.  This is what we call fundamentalism.  An 'ism' that was birthed as a reaction to the crisis of modernity.  Feeling intimidated by the Scientific Revolution, fundamentalism takes a “scientific” approach to the Bible—which is perhaps the worst of all ways to approach Scripture.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/08aaae7601912da8d29c68cb92fd132d9d295b09.jpg"></article>]]></description>
