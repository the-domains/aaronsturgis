## Fundamentalism is to Christianity.....

It's been crazy yet compelling for many.  Somewhere along the course of history the idea that science and religion (particularly Christianity) could not co-exist.  It was an either/or. It drives me nuts when some Christians believe that we have a fight against science. That somehow science is against faith. There is this idea (and it has only grown in recent decades) that if you are Christian then Science is against faith.  This is what we call fundamentalism.  An 'ism' that was birthed as a reaction to the crisis of modernity.  Feeling intimidated by the Scientific Revolution, fundamentalism takes a "scientific" approach to the Bible---which is perhaps the worst of all ways to approach Scripture.

The Bible never claims to be a science book. So when we look at it as a science book we then take it completely out of context. There are things in the Bible that no longer make sense because of the gift of Science.  for example, the Bible says the sun revolves around the earth. Well we discovered through science that the earth revolves around the sun. The Bible was never intended to be a science book.

Romans 1:20 "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities - his eternal power and divine nature - have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse." We learn from science.  The Bible is not interested in giving (or even competing with) scientific explanations.

The Bible is intended to give witness to the finger of God who creates science.  What Scripture gives us is inspired glimpses into the divine mystery. The point is never to "prove" the Bible, but to enter into the mystery through Scripture. The Bible has no interest in "proving" itself---it has no need to do this and makes no attempt to do so. The Bible is not a scientific text or even an end in itself, the Bible is the Spirit-inspired sign that points us to the true Word of God---the Word made flesh, the greatest of all sacred mysteries.

In our search for certainty and our desire for Bible-Answer-Man explanations, the Christian mystery is then turned into gift shop trinkets. Fundamentalism is to Christianity what paint-by-numbers is to art.  If we insist on explaining the mysteries of faith---mysteries like the Trinity, the Incarnation, the Resurrection, the Ascension, the return of Christ, the new birth, baptism, the Eucharist---we inevitably reduce rich mysteries to cheap certitudes. This is the bane of fundamentalism. Now science is limited in what we can know about God but it is one of the ways we learn. 

Now science is limited in what we can know about God but it is one of the ways we learn.  But mystery is good (and needed!) for faith. And mystery is good for the soul. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dae9bdd3-84a9-425f-8cf6-805f7cde54c0.jpg)
